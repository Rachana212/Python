This Jupyter notebook (Seaborn.ipynb) illustrates how to use Seaborn, a powerful Python library for statistical data visualization, to create elegant and informative plots. The notebook covers:

Basic setup and importing of required packages (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.)

Loading and preparing data for visualization

Creating a variety of plot types:
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Scatterplots
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Line plots
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Bar plots
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Box plots
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Histograms / distribution plots

â€‚â€‚â€¢ Themes, styles, color palettes
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Titles, axis labels, legends
â€‚â€‚â€¢ Annotating charts and fine-tuning layout

Use cases / examples of interpreting the plots

Best practices in choosing the right chart type for the data

ðŸ›  How to Use

Clone or download the repository.

Open Seaborn.ipynb in Jupyter (or JupyterLab / VSCode).

Execute the cells sequentially, observing how each visualization is built up.

Modify the data or parameters to experiment with your own datasets.
